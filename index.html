<p>Gossip simulator using akka actor</p>

<p>The input provided (as command line to topologyTest.scala) will be of the form:</p>

<p>topologyTest.scala numNodes topology algorithm</p>

<p>Where 
numNodes is the number of actors involved (for 2D based topologies it is round up until it is a square),
topology is one of full, 2D, line, imp2D, 
algorithm is one of gossip, push-sum.</p>

<p>Output: Print the amount of time it took to achieve convergence of the algorithm.</p>

<p>The actual network topology plays a critical role in the dissemination speed of Gossip protocols. This project experiments
with various topologies. The topology determines who is considered a neighbour in the above algorithms.</p>

<a name="current-topologies-implemented" class="anchor" href="#current-topologies-implemented"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Topologies Implemented</h1>

<p> Full Network - Every actor is a neighbour of all other actors. That is,every actor can talk directly to any other actors.</p>

<p> 2D Grid - Actors form a 2D grid. The actors can only talk to the grid neighbours.</p>

<p> Line: Actors are arranged in a line. Each actor has only 2 neighbours (one left and one right, unless you are the first or last actor).</p>

<p> Imperfect 2D Grid: Grid arrangement but one random other neighbour is selected from the list of all actors (4+1 neighbours).</p>

<a name="communication-algorithms" class="anchor" href="#communication-algorithms"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Communication Algorithms</h1>

<p>Gossip Algorithm for information propagation ----&gt;</p>

<p> Starting: A participant(actor) it told/sent a rumor(fact) by the main process</p>

<p> Step: Each actor selects a random neighbour and tells it the rumor</p>

<p> Termination: Each actor keeps track of rumors and how many times it has heard the rumor. It stops transmitting once it has heard the rumor N times (N is currently set to 10 which is arbitrary, This parameter can be modified in the regularJoe class).</p>

<p>Push-Sum algorithm for sum computation  ----&gt;</p>

<p> State: Each actor Ai maintains two quantities: s and w. Initially, s = xi = i (that is actor number i has value i) and w = 1
 
Starting: Ask one of the actors to start from the main process.</p>

<p>Receive: Messages sent and received are pairs of the form (s;w). Upon receive, an actor should add received pair to its own corresponding values. Upon receive, each actor selects a random neighbour and sends it a message.</p>

<p>Send: When sending a message to another actor, half of s and w is kept by the sending actor and half is placed in the message.</p>

<p>Sum estimate: At any given moment of time, the sum estimate is s/w where s and w are the current values of an actor.</p>

<p>Termination: If an actors ratio s/w did not change more than 10^-10 in 3 consecutive rounds the actor terminates.</p>
